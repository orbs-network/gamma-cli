# Gamma - Personal Orbs Blockchain for Developers 

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/orbs-network/gamma-cli.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/orbs-network/gamma-cli)

Gamma is a personal Orbs blockchain that allows developers to easily test, run and deploy smart contracts.

`Gamma server` - runs an in-memory virtual chain on top of an Orbs blockchain with several nodes on your local machine.

`gamma-cli` - command line tool for developers to interact with a Gamma server instance running on their machine. 


## Detailed documentation

The detailed documentation website for Gamma is available here:

## Quick start

<details>
<summary>Mac</summary>

### Prerequisites
* Make sure [brew](https://brew.sh/) is available on your machine.
* Make sure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) is installed on your machine.
* If you're planning to develop your own smart contracts in Go 
    * Install [Go language](https://golang.org/doc/install#macos)
    * Install the [Orbs Smart Contract SDK](https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-contract-sdk#installation)

### Installation
1. To install the command line tool, run the following command in terminal:
    ```
    brew install orbs-network/devtools/gamma-cli
    ```
    > To verify the installation, run in terminal `gamma-cli version`
    
2. Gamma server will automatically be installed the first time you start it with `gamma-cli start-local`

### Starting and stopping Gamma server 

* Start Gamma server by running in terminal:
    ```
    gamma-cli start-local
    ```
* When finished working with the server, stop it by running in terminal:
    ```
    gamma-cli stop-local
    ```
    > Note: The local blockchain instance is running in-memory. The next time you start the instance, all contracts and state will disappear from memory and you will need to deploy them again.

<details>
    <summary>Windows</summary>

### Prerequisites
* Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is installed on your machine.
* If you're planning to develop your own smart contracts in Go 
    * Install [Go language](https://golang.org/doc/install#windows)
    * Install the [Orbs Smart Contract SDK](https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-contract-sdk#installation)

### Installation
* Download latest version of Gamma from [releases](https://github.com/orbs-network/gamma-cli/releases)
* Extract the archive to `Program Files`
* Edit `$profile` settings of PowerShell
   * Create a file: `C:\Users\<Your User>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` or edit it.
   * Add the following content:
   ```bash
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
   New-Alias gamma-cli 'C:\Program Files\gammacli-windows-v0.7.0\_bin\gamma-cli.exe'
   ```
* Verify the installation: open PowerShell and run `gamma-cli version`. You should see the current version, e.g. `v0.7.0`

### Starting and stopping Gamma server 

* Start Gamma server by running in terminal:
    ```
    gamma-cli start-local
    ```
* When finished working with the server, stop it by running in terminal:
    ```
